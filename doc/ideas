A heirarchical namespace of identifiers (which includes both resources and pure data)

  The heirarchy can exist as directories, but can also exist nested within a file

    But you can't define the same namespace in two different ways

Each identifier has an explicit type (file, package, service, set)

  Except primitives

String interpolation

Dependencies are given by identifiers

  But you can also depend on a whole namespace

    And namespaces implicitly depend on all their contents

Functions

  No recursion

  Parameters are typed

Identifiers can be private (which restricts them to their namespace and descendants)

  Entire namespaces can also be private

Resources aren't all realized automatically

  You identify the root resource when starting

File templates

  Interpolation of variables

  They are automatically placed in the namespace heirarchy according to
  position in the directory tree
